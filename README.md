# An Exploration of Sources in Bias in Data
This repository contains the code, resulting data, analysis, and discussion for an exploration of sources of bias in Wikipedia articles on political figures from a variety of countries. This work was originally completed as part of the University of Washington's DATA 512 course in Autumn 2018. The goal of this assignment was to identify bias in Wikipedia data and complete a discussion of the potential sources and consequences of such bias.
